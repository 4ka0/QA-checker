Program for performing various QA checks on a Jap>Eng tmx file.
Checks for the following issues:
    Inconsistent numbers (missing or extra numbers)
    Double spaces etc.
    Repeated words
    Unpaired symbols such as parentheses
    Untranslated segments
Takes three arguments to execute from the command line:
    python3 checker.py yourfile.tmx
Results sent to stdout.
